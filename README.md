# Light-seeking-robot

##1.0: Light-seeking robot with fixed antennae
-	Use phototransistors to detect different light intensity
-	Different values of currents flow in BJTs under different light intensity
-	Adjust 2 wheelsâ€™ speeds according to light intensity, so that the robot moves towards the light
##2.0: Light-seeking robot with moving antennae
-	Use PWM to generate the sinusoidal displacement of the shafts --> moving antennae
-	The servo motors are connected to 2 antennae which can oscillate in range between 75 and 115 degrees --> Larger detection area --> More precise moving

- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhi5gCm9124) shows the performance of the robot.
